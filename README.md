## Overview

This repository contains the result of following the "Complete Guide To Building A REST API" tutorial by Code with Antonio. The tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for creating a RESTful API using popular technologies such as Node.js, Express, Typescript, and MongoDB. It aims to guide developers through the process of building a robust API for handling HTTP requests and interacting with a MongoDB database.

## Installation

To get started with the tutorial, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will be running at http://localhost:8080, and you can begin making requests to the API endpoints as described in the tutorial.

For testing and interacting with the API endpoints, you can use tools like Postman or equivalent. Postman allows you to send HTTP requests to your API and inspect the responses, making it easy to test different endpoints and scenarios.
